# Elastic Agent GCP Kubernetes Application

[GCP Kubernetes Application](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-applications) are pre-packages application that can be run in a Kubernetes cluster. GCP console allows installing them via a simplified procedure (GUI or CLI based) and they can potentially be sold in the GCP Marketplace. However, our listing of Elastic Agent as a Kubernetes App would be free.

Is possible to install this application in [non-GKE clusters too](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/kubernetes-apps/deploying-non-gke-clusters).
