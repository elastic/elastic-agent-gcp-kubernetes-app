# GCP Kubernetes App for Elastic Agent

[GCP Kubernetes App] are pre-packages application that can be run in a Kubernetes cluster. GCP console allows installing them via a simplified procedure (GUI or CLI based) and they can potentially be sold in the GCP Marketplace. However, our listing of Elastic Agent as a Kubernetes App would be free.

Is possible to install this application in [non-GKE clusters too].
